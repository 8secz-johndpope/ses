The SendRawEmail operation is particularly useful for sending multipart MIME emails (such as those that contain both a plain-text and an HTML version).  In order to send email using the SendRawEmail operation, your message must meet the following requirements:   The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. If you attempt to send email using a non-verified address or domain, the operation will result in an "Email address not verified" error.    If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.    The total size of the message, including attachments, must be smaller than 10 MB.

The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call the SendRawEmail operation several times to send the message to each group.    For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your sending quota). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the SendRawEmail operation:   Although you can customize the message headers when using the SendRawEmail operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own Message-ID and Date headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.   If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, SendRawEmail enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters SourceArn, FromArn, and/or ReturnPathArn to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:    X-SES-SOURCE-ARN     X-SES-FROM-ARN     X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN     Do not include these X-headers in the DKIM signature; Amazon SES will remove them before sending the email.  For most common sending authorization scenarios, we recommend that you specify the SourceIdentityArn parameter and not the FromIdentityArn or ReturnPathIdentityArn parameters. If you only specify the SourceIdentityArn parameter, Amazon SES will set the From and Return Path addresses to the identity specified in SourceIdentityArn. For more information about sending authorization, see the Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.
