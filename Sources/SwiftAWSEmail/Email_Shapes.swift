For example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the default master key in the US West (Oregon) region, the ARN of the default master key would be arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses. If you use the default master key, you don't need to perform any extra steps to give Amazon SES permission to use the key.

For more information about giving permissions, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   For more information about key policies, see the AWS KMS Developer Guide. If you do not specify a master key, Amazon SES will not encrypt your emails.  Your mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption client before the mail is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is not encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to use your AWS KMS keys for decryption. This encryption client is currently available with the AWS Java SDK and AWS Ruby SDK only. For more information about client-side encryption using AWS KMS master keys, see the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

Amazon Web Services will eventually detect that you have updated your DNS records; this detection process may take up to 72 hours. Upon successful detection, Amazon SES will be able to DKIM-sign emails originating from that domain. For more information about creating DNS records using DKIM tokens, go to the Amazon SES Developer Guide.
